			<p> Throughout my life I have always been passionate about programming and have learned many coding languages such as, C/C++, Python, SQL, and many more. I have also familiarized myself with Linux, OpenGL, Unity3D along with other applications and libraries.</P>
            <p> I first found my passion for programming at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology where I graduated with my diploma electronics engineering. Wanting to enhance my knowledge, I entered the University of Calgary to pursue a degree in Computer science. It was at the University of Calgary that I became more interested in computer graphics, due to my love of video games. I spent countless hours on campus perfecting my projects, and I loved every minute of it. My hard work paid off and my professors recognized my ability to go above and beyond the scope of my projects and assignments. By 2019 I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Computer Graphics.</p>
			<p> I also obtained a minor in Japanese Language after going to Senshu University in Japan. My time in Japan was primarily spent learning the language and immersing myself in the culture. To this day I still practice my Japanese weekly and am able to speak the language fluently.</p>
			<p> After graduation, I spent most of my spare time testing and programming small games with colleagues from university. We created a bullet hell game called Element X and released a fully developed version on the popular PC gaming store, Steam. Aside from programming, I was in charge of hiring and managing a variety of talented individuals from different fields to compliment our game.</p>
			<p> If you would like more details about Element X and other projects Iâ€™ve worked on it can be found in the <a href = "projects.html">Projects</a> section on this site. </p>
