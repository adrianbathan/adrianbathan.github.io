            <p> After graduating electronics engineering at SAIT, I realized I enjoyed programming and decided to transfer to Computer Science at the University of Calgary. I originally planned on concentrating in games programming because I have always enjoyed video games. However around my third year into the program, I discovered my passion for computer graphics. I enjoyed working on graphics to the extent where I would stay days or even up to a week on campus working on my assignments and projects. Eventually, I excelled in all my third and fourth year classes, was recognized by most of the computer graphics professors, and graduated with a
				Bachelors in Computer Science and a Concentration in Computer Graphics	</p>
			<p> Aside from graphics, I took a few Japanese Language classes as electives during my time at the University of Calgary. This eventually resulted in taking some time off programming and doing a study abroad session in Japan at Senshu University for a semester. Upon returning, I decided to continue studying the language and I also graduated with a minor in Japanese. To this day, I like to keep in touch with my friends in Japan and continue practicing my Japanese with them or teaching them English. </p>
			<p> After graduation, I spent a lot of my spare time playing games and programming small games with some friends from university. We made many variants of bullet hell games we called Element X and eventually we decided to take it a step further and release a fully completed game on Steam. 
			We recruited composers, artists, and many beta testers that we met through our friends to help us release our game. </p>
			<p> More details about Element X and other projects Iâ€™ve worked on can be found in the <a href = "projects.html">Projects</a> section on this site. </p>
