            <p> I found myself becoming passionate in programming in SAIT where I graduated in electronics engineering. Wanting to quench my interest, I entered University of Calgary to pursue a degree in Computer science. It was at University of Calgary that I became more immersed in graphics due to my love of video games. I was so immersed that I spent days to a full week on campus excelling on projects and assignments. My professors recognized my hard work during my third and fourth year and I graduated computer science with a concentration in computer graphics. </p>
			<p>  I also obtained a minor in Japanese after going aboard to senshu university to exchange language and culture knowledge with Japanese students. Even to this day I still keep in touch with those friends to brush up on my Japanese and also to help them practice English. </p>
			<p> After graduation, I spent a lot of my spare time testing games and programming small games with some friends from university. We made variants of bullet hell games we called Element X and eventually we decided to take it a step further and release a fully completed game on Steam. 
			We recruited composers, artists, and many beta testers that we met through our friends to help us release our game. </p>
			<p> More details about Element X and other projects Iâ€™ve worked on can be found in the <a href = "projects.html">Projects</a> section on this site. </p>
